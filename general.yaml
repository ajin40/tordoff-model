# How many agents to begin the simulation? Ex. 1000
num_to_start: 5000

# Do you want to use NVIDIA CUDA acceleration for some computationally tasking methods? Ex. True
cuda: False

# What will the final step number be? Use for when you are beginning a new simulation (mode: 0). Ex. 192
end_step: 50000

# What are the dimensions (xyz) of the space? Ex. [4000, 4000, 0]
size: [1, 1, 0]

# Do you want the agent array values outputted to a CSV at each step? Ex. True
output_values: True

# Do you want an image produced at each step and a video at the end of the simulation? Ex. True
output_images: True

# What is the image width in pixels? Currently imaging is supported for a 2D space, though a 3D space will yield
# a bird's eye view of the space. Image slicing/3D images to come... Ex. 2000
image_quality: 3250

# What is the video width in pixels? This will scale the step images to the video resolution
# (combined with interpolation) to potentially reduce the file size of the video. Ex. 1000
video_quality: 3250

# What should the frames-per-second (FPS) of the resulting video comprised of step images be? Ex. 10.0
fps: 10
