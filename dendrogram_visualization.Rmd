## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r plot_trees}
file_name = '/Users/andrew/PycharmProjects/tordoff_model/Outputs/dendrogram_test2_clusterthresh3/dendrogram_clusters_0.txt'
trees_txt <- readChar(file_name, file.info(file_name)$size)
myTree <- ape::read.tree(text=trees_txt)

#print(myTree)


plot(myTree, no.margin=FALSE, cex=0.5, label.offset = 5, direction="downwards", show.tip.label = FALSE, align.tip.label=TRUE)
plot.window(xlim= c(0, 100), ylim=c(0,200))
axis(2); title(xlab="Cluster", ylab="Time", main = "30% HEK")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
